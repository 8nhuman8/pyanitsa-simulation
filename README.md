## Information about the game

> ### Rules

> The game uses a deck of 36, 52 or 54 cards. The game can be played by two to eight players.
> The deck is distributed equally to all players. Players do not look at their cards, but place them in a pile next to them. The first player to walk removes the top card from his pile and places it in the center of the table open. Other players in a circle do the same. The player, whose card turned out to be older than all the others, removes his own and the “broken” cards and puts them in another pile (option: at the bottom of his pile); the order of folding the cards in different versions of the game can obey one or another rule or be arbitrary, which allows one or another strategy to be carried out in order to capture the highest cards from the opponent.
> The player who has lost all of his cards is eliminated from the game.
> The winner is the player who has the entire deck in the pile. A giveaway game is also possible, in which the winner is the one who gets rid of his cards first.

> ### Dispute

> If two or more players have the same cards (this situation is called a "dispute"), then each of these players puts one more card on top, and the one whose card is older than all the others removes the cards. Option - each "arguing" player lays out two cards, one face down ("pawn"), and one face-down, which determines who takes the cards at stake. If among the three players two arguing cards are less than the third, then the third with the higher card automatically wins, and the dispute is canceled. If the player does not have cards to conduct a dispute, then he takes all the dispute cards. If the player has one card left, then the dispute goes on without a gap.
